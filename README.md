# json-resume-editor
Editor for JSON Resume (https://jsonresume.org/)

Project started 11 November 2019. This is a progressive development over the coming months.

The aim is 2 fold:

1) Create an editor for JSON Resume (which I now use as my primary professional profile).
2) Create a VueJS (https://vuejs.org/) application to use as a foundation for teaching "VueJS by Example".

This README will be updated when the project starts to stabalise.

Projected completion Feb/March 2020.
